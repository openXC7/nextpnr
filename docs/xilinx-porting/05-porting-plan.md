# 05 — Porting plan: nextpnr-xilinx → upstream himbaechel/xilinx

> **Status: draft for review.** Synthesises doc 01 (upstream architecture),
> doc 02 (fork inventory), doc 03 (algorithmic diff), doc 04 (gap list).
>
> **Governing philosophy: upstream first, fork fills the blanks.**
> Upstream nextpnr (and its himbaechel/xilinx uarch) is the *successor*
> of nextpnr-xilinx: it carries years of architecture and algorithm
> development (StrictLegaliser, control-set API, parallel_refine,
> timing_opt, placer_static, the router2 superset, the RelPtr chipdb
> model). Every decision below therefore **prefers the upstream
> solution**; nextpnr-xilinx material is imported only where upstream has
> a *blank* (missing legality checks, missing packers, missing FASM
> correctness fixes, missing validation) — never as a replacement for
> upstream code that exists. Where upstream already has an equivalent
> (e.g. `--report`, himbaechel framework, control-set checks), the fork's
> version is explicitly *not* ported.

## 0. Strategy & principles

1. **Prefer upstream solutions.** Upstream nextpnr is the successor
   architecture of nextpnr-xilinx: years of architecture/algorithmic
   development live there (RelPtr chipdb model, StrictLegaliser, the
   control-set API, `parallel_refine`, `timing_opt`, `placer_static`,
   the router2 superset). Every decision in this plan therefore keeps
   the upstream implementation wherever one exists, and imports fork
   material **only to fill blanks**. Concretely: keep the upstream
   `StrictLegaliser` (same greedy random-walk family as the fork's,
   refactored with bel buckets and control-set pre-allocation) but
   **also port the fork's termination guarantees** (fail-fast,
   deterministic fallback, eviction-as-last-resort) since the same walk
   family retains their livelock risk (doc 03 corrigendum). Do not port
   fork placer/router code wholesale — port *checks, data, and
   robustness guarantees*, and skip anything upstream already has (e.g.
   `--report`, the himbaechel framework, control-set checks).
2. **Legality first.** The five high-risk missing checks (OUTMUX budget,
   cross-position carry→FF rejection, FF1-uses-X+5FF co-pack, SRL cascade
   placement, CFG preplacement — doc 03 §4) gate everything else: without
   them, upstream's legaliser will re-create the exact illegal slices the
   fork's bugfixes reject.
3. **Port at the fork's own maturity order.** The fork's 0.9.2→0.9.3 digest
   shows the proven fix sequence: placement legality → FASM correctness →
   primitive modes → constraints → CI gate.
4. **Validate with golden bitstreams** (fork CI's normalised-hash method) at
   every work package, not at the end.
5. **No code changes, no commits** until these documents are reviewed and
   the user approves implementation work (per repo policy).
6. **xc7 only — UltraScale(+) porting is explicitly EXCLUDED.** This plan
   ports Xilinx 7-series (xc7) support only: artix7, kintex7, zynq7,
   spartan7, virtex7. The fork's UltraScale/UltraScale+ work — the
   `xcup` RapidWright flow, E2/E3/E4 packers (CARRY8, RAMB36E2, DSP48E2,
   URAM288, ISERDESE3/OSERDESE3, …), xcup device databases, and the
   DCP/RapidWright export tooling — is **out of scope by decision**.
   UltraScale-related observations in docs 01–04 are recorded for
   completeness only; they are not inputs to this plan and must not be
   implemented under it.

## 1. Work packages (ordered)

### WP0 — Device-list & build foundation (small, no risk) — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (pending build validation)
- ✅ Added `xc7k70t/160t/325t/420t/480t`, `xc7z030/045/100`, `xc7vx485t`
  to `ALL_HIMBAECHEL_XILINX_DEVICES` (`himbaechel/uarch/xilinx/CMakeLists.txt:32`);
  `xc7z035` deferred — no die dir in openXC7 prjxray-db (part dirs only).
- ✅ Virtex-7 plumbing: CMake `xc7v` → virtex7 mapping; gen script virtex7
  metadata selection + artix7 timings fallback (`xilinx_gen.py`); device
  regex extended to `xc7vx\d+t?` (`xilinx.cc:81`).
- ✅ Meta sync: submodule switched gatecat → **openXC7/nextpnr-xilinx-meta**
  master (`a4af910`, adds virtex7 site types + kintex7 PCIE_2_1;
  `.gitmodules` URL updated).
- ⚠ a35t: openXC7 prjxray-db (`ab1fc60`) has a35t *part* dirs but **no a35t
  die dir** — the a35t→a50t die alias (`xilinx.cc:86`) therefore stays
  (chipdbs are die-level); correcting the earlier assumption that the fork
  had a real a35t die.
- **Validate**: chipdb gen + build for xc7a50t/xc7k325t/xc7vx485t/xc7z045
  (in progress); then `arty-a35` blinky + archcheck.

### WP1 — Port the legality engine (core, must be first) — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (validation in progress)
Ported into `himbaechel/uarch/xilinx/xilinx_place.cc` (re-expressed over
`LogicTileStatus`/`XilinxCellTags`; no `constr_*` walks exist upstream):
1. ✅ Per-position OUTMUX (site-exit) budget — fork `arch_place.cc:424-506`.
2. ✅ Cross-position carry→FF flat rejection + 5FF-fed-by-carry rejection —
   fork `arch_place.cc:731-745, 766-774`; also added CO as a direct-feed
   shape for the main FF (missing upstream).
3. ✅ Main-FF-via-X-bypass + 5FF co-pack rejection — fork `arch_place.cc:789-804`.
4. ✅ Strengthened 5LUT A6/O6 gate (connected-input count + A6 check,
   memory/SRL exempt) and made the SLICEM-only guard unconditional — fork
   `arch_place.cc:368-423, 626-656`.
5. ✅ Per-candidate gate: satisfied by making checks 1/2/4 unconditional —
   they now run on every `isBelLocationValid` call even when the tile's
   dirty cache is clean, so no separate `isValidBelForCell` hook is needed.
6. ✅ Carry-chain continuation + CO/OUTMUX contention (CO3 spine exception,
   CO0..2 always claim) — fork `arch_place.cc:477-491, 859-887`.
7. ✅ SRL16E pair exemption in the 6LUT+5LUT coexistence/shared-input checks
   (fork `arch_place.cc:548-583`).
- ⏭ Not ported (hybrid Vivado-import flow only, out of scope): frozen-tile
  fast path, imported-slot/BEL exemptions, `lut_routethru_feed` exemption,
  `NEXTPNR_ALLOW_CO_5FF_CONTENTION` env, `dbg_validity_runtime` tracing.
- **Validate**: litex-ddr-arty-s7 (the design that exposed the fork's carry
  bugs) × seeds 1–4 on xc7s50 (running); blinky/arty-a35 regression passed;
  unit tests deferred to WP9.

### WP2 — FASM correctness cluster (independent of WP1, high value) — 🔄 in progress
Port in commit-sized units, each with a bitstream-hash check:
1. ✅ Phantom-BUFGCTRL guard (fork `fasm.cc:122`) — committed.
2. 🔄 HP-bank IO glue: of the five fork commits, **two apply upstream**
   (✅ `6f33adf0` SSTL15/135 SLEW.SLOW group skip; ✅ `e4a261ce` IN_ONLY
   partner-output gate). The other three guard emissions upstream does not
   yet have (`d6b7f64d` IBUF_HP_BANK_GLUE, `70a5952c` cross-site
   SLEW.SLOW defaults, `c2e50b99` diff-input SLEW.SLOW) — deferred until
   the corresponding HP-glue emissions are ported, not dropped.
3. SDP BRAM opposite-port width + 36-wide marker + ZINV_REGCLK*
   (`f1c77134`, `11f9b694`, `1b7d51b9`, `e71acda2`).
4. ✅ OSERDES/ILOGIC bits: `IS_CLKDIV_INVERTED`, `TRISTATE_WIDTH.W4`,
   `IFF.INV_OCLK` (`b9ed05a2`, `c05f0d05`).
5. ✅ PLL LKTABLE/TABLE from PLL-specific tables (`e33b5f1a`,
   `74357a79`) — 63-entry tables indexed by CLKFBOUT_MULT, BANDWIDTH=LOW
   table, harvested from Vivado goldens.
6. ✅ BUFR_DIVIDE on placed BUFR (`0b914578`) + BUFR packing/placement +
   HCLK_IOI pip-filter fix (see WP4.4 note).
7. Run-identity FASM header (`7037c948`) — trivial, do first as a warm-up.
- **Validate**: fork CI's normalised bitstream-hash comparison on
  arty-s7/arty/kintex7 demo projects (needs WP9 CI scaffolding or local
  equivalents).

### WP3 — Primitive packer gaps (feature-level)
1. **MUXF9 on xc7** via `SELMUX2_1` (fork `pack.cc:670` tree) — replace
   upstream's `log_error` (`pack.cc:441`).
2. ✅ **BUFH** (non-CE) cell + packing: BUFH/BUFHCE → `BUFHCE_BUFHCE` with
   CE tied active in `prepare_clocking`, + `try_preplace` in
   `preplace_clocking`; constids `X(BUFH)`, `X(BUFHCE_BUFHCE)` added
   (upstream previously packed NEITHER BUFH nor BUFHCE).
3. **Dist-RAM**: RAM512X1S/D, RAM32M16, RAM64M8, RAM64X2S, RAM64X8SW;
   RAM128X1S scalar A0..A6; RAM256X1S mux-tree slice-half/zoffset fixes
   (`c0194daf`, `363c055d`, `b390e9c9`).
4. **SRL**: Q31 support + cascade placement rules (`constrain_srl_cascades`,
   `pack.cc:763`, `697e293b`) — depends on WP1 item 7.
5. ✅ **IDDR**: `DDR_CLK_EDGE=SAME_EDGE_PIPELINED` + 4-IFF-flop init
   (`9a6a7e3b`, `d455ae52`); routethru SRTYPE fixes (`f77907ac`,
   `16accf3b`) inapplicable upstream (pp_config already omits SRTYPE).
6. **ISERDES/OSERDES**: OFB placement, master/slave pairing parity with fork
   (`pack_io_xc7.cc:903-1106`).
7. **IDELAYCTRL** no-delay → warning (`06769c05`).
8. ✅ **IBUFGDS** alias of IBUFDS (`55c3bc87`): constid `X(IBUFGDS)` +
   `cells.cc` port list + `pins.cc` toplevel + `is_diff_ibuf` test + HR/HP
   rule maps. OBUFDS swapped-pin diagnostic (`0ebf6394`) pending.
- **Validate**: fork `primitive-tests/` repo designs + demo projects;
  targeted synth of each primitive via `synth_xilinx`.

### WP4 — Placement & routing decisions (follows WP1) — 🔄 partially done
1. ⏭ **`relocate_carry_o_fabric` decision: DEFERRED.** With the WP1 legality
   checks in place, the upstream legaliser+router absorb the common O+CO
   dual-fanout cases; litex-ddr-arty-s7 (the fork's carry regression design)
   passes ×4 seeds. The netlist-level pass will be ported only if a concrete
   failing case appears.
2. ⏳ **Delay model**: replace himbaechel's coarse `estimateDelay/predictDelay`
   (`xilinx.cc:735-780`, has a TODO referencing the fork) with the fork's
   site/inter-wire/intent-aware version (`arch.cc:650-762`) — prerequisite
   for meaningful timing-driven results (doc 03 §6 risk 5).
3. ✅ **router2 config**: new `HimbaechelAPI::configureRouter2()` hook (set in
   `Arch::route()`); XilinxImpl sets `bb_margin_{x,y}=4`,
   `backwards_max_iter=200`, `perf_profile=true`.
4. ⏳ **routeVcc + clock-backbone ordering**: port the fork's clock-first /
   Vcc-post-fill ordering and pip blacklist to avoid the "Vcc floods the
   clock backbone" failure (doc 03 §6 risk 8; fork `arch.cc:912,1752,351`).
5. ✅ **Final timing analysis after router2** (`7ea51730`): added generically
   in `Arch::route()` — router2 previously ran no final analysis (router1
   does); verified post-route fmax report appears.
6. Keep `fixupPlacement` as belt-and-braces only if WP1 proves insufficient;
   port the STRENGTH_USER-vs-STRONG skip distinction (doc 03 §6 risk 6).

### WP5 — XDC parser improvements (small, user-visible) — 🔄 code done, build pending
From coordinator note `drafts/00c`:
1. ✅ `name[0]` de-busing retry in `get_cells` + `get_nets` (`b257be4d`).
2. ✅ Silent non-design targets unless `--verbose` + summary line
   (`3da43687`, `555d326c`) — misses now itemise only in verbose mode.
3. ✅ Virtual-clock skip guard and "constraint NOT applied" warning.
4. ⏭ BEL-attr-unknown-tile non-fatal (`8399469c`) — verify upstream
   behaviour separately (placement-time, not parser).
5. ⏳ **set_multicycle_path**: check upstream SDC path (`common/kernel/sdc.cc`)
   before porting the `NEXTPNR_MCP_SETUP` attribute hack — prefer the
   upstream mechanism.

### WP6 — Config/misc IP preplacement (easy after WP1)
BSCANE2, DNA_PORT, EFUSE_USR, ICAPE2, FRAME_ECCE2, STARTUPE2,
USR_ACCESSE2, DCIRESET — single-site preplacement per fork
`pack_io_xc7.cc:1232` (`d42d6c9b`) + FASM emission. Depends on the
preplacement mechanism from WP1.

### WP7 — GT transceivers (GTPE2/GTXE2) (larger)
Port `pack_gt_xc7.cc` (380 L) + `fasm.cc` GT writers (GTP/GTX channel,
common, IBUFDS_GTE2 refclk, PLL remap) + GT-clock template route for
virtex7. Depends on WP0 (kintex7/virtex7 devices). Highest-value for the
workspace's kintex7 focus.

### WP8 — EXCLUDED: UltraScale / UltraScale+ porting (xc7-only decision)

**Explicitly out of scope.** The fork's xcup flow (RapidWright BBA
export, E2/E3/E4 packers, xcup device databases, DCP export,
UltraScale+ FASM writers) will **not** be ported under this plan
(principle 6). No UltraScale work package exists; anything
UltraScale-related found in the fork is ignored for the purposes of
this effort. If UltraScale support is ever desired, it must be planned
as a separate project with its own documents.

### WP9 — Validation & CI (runs alongside all packages)
1. Add xilinx gtest coverage (upstream `tests/` has none for himbaechel;
   `ng-ultra` shows the pattern) — port fork slice-legality/DRAM/BRAM cases.
2. Port the fork's per-PR demos gate (`.github/workflows/demos.yml`):
   build PR binary + chipdbs (xc7s50, xc7a35t, xc7k325t), build demo
   projects, compare normalised bitstream hashes vs goldens, upload `.bit`.
3. Golden set: start from the fork's committed goldens (they are the same
   designs); re-golden after intentional FASM changes with review.
4. `archcheck` stays as the fast gate.

## 2. Dependency graph

```
WP0 ──┬── WP1 ──┬── WP3 (SRL cascades, carry modes)
      │         ├── WP4 (carry-O decision, delay model, router2 cfg, Vcc/clk ordering)
      │         └── WP6 (config IP preplacement)
      ├── WP2 (FASM)        ← independent, can run in parallel with WP1
      ├── WP5 (XDC)         ← independent
      ├── WP7 (GT)          ← needs WP0 kintex7/virtex7 devices
      └── WP9 (CI/tests)    ← starts immediately, gates every WP
WP8 (UltraScale/xcup) — EXCLUDED by decision, not part of this graph.
```

## 3. Suggested execution order (fastest path to a releasable state)

1. WP9 scaffolding + WP2.7 (run-identity header) — CI warm-up.
2. WP0 (device list) → WP1 (legality) → WP4.3/4.4 (router2 cfg + Vcc/clock
   ordering) → WP2 (FASM cluster).
3. WP3 → WP5 → WP6 → WP7.

This mirrors the fork's own 0.9.2→0.9.3 sequence (legality fixes first,
then FASM, then primitive modes), which is the empirically proven order.

## 4. Risks & mitigations (from doc 03 §6)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `constr_*`/ClusterId API mismatch silently no-ops ported heuristics | Re-express via ClusterId/BelBucketId; add asserts; review each port |
| Upstream legaliser produces illegal slices without WP1 checks | WP1 first; golden-bitstream diff catches bit corruption |
| Coarse upstream delay model degrades timing QoR | WP4.2 (fork delay model) before enabling timing-driven flows |
| Fixed-routes/frozen-import features not ported | Accept the hybrid-flow features as out of scope (doc 03 §5.8) unless user needs them |
| Fork repo advances mid-port (it gained 8 commits while analysing) | Re-diff at each milestone; tag 0.9.3 is the current reference |
| UltraScale scope creep | Excluded by principle 6: xcup/E2/E3/E4 content is ignored; review gates reject UltraScale changes |

## 5. Definition of done

- All doc 04 gap rows resolved (ported or explicitly deferred with reason),
  **excluding UltraScale/xcup rows, which are out of scope by decision**.
- Doc 03 §4 must-port checks present + unit-tested in upstream tree.
- Demo-projects golden-bitstream hashes match (post re-golden review) on
  xc7s50, xc7a35t, xc7k325t.
- Upstream CI (archcheck + demos gate) green; non-xilinx arches unaffected.
- No UltraScale(+) code, device databases, or tooling has been added.
- Documents 01–04 updated to reflect the final state.
